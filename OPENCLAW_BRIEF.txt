🎯 YALLWALL PROJECT BRIEF

WHAT IS IT:
YallWall is a hyper-local, real-time chat platform - like a "living room" for your city. Think Facebook Groups but ephemeral (24hr disappearing messages), faster, and mobile-first.

✅ One-tap incident reporting (Phase 2)

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime WebSockets)
- Hosting: GoDaddy + Cloudflare
- Domain: yallwall.com
